# Day 1 – Prompt vs Pipeline Behavior

Goal:
Understand how LLM behavior is driven more by instructions and constraints than by pipeline labels.

Key Observation:
Using the same model (FLAN-T5), different instructions produce different behaviors even across similar pipelines.

Status:
Foundational learning. Not production-ready.
